# NodeJS Candidate Test

## Basic knowledge questions

- What are Promises in Node.js?

- What is callback hell?

- What tools can be used to assure consistent style?

- What is REPL? What purpose it is used for?

- What is the difference between Asynchronous and Non-blocking?

- List types of Http requests supported by Node.js?

- Is Node.js entirely based on a single-thread?

- What is your favourite HTTP framework and why?

- What is difference between JavaScript and Node.js?

- What is TypeScript? Do you use it? Why / why not?

## Problem solving

You get an error report from testing crew - User API doesn't return "Test User" data for ID: 1.
Code is in this repository.

**Find out why, fix it and write report on why did it happen.**

## Create something whilst learning something new

- Deploy an AWS API GW
- Deploy and connect your lambda
- Your lambda should take in a POST request that takes in name and age and place that item on an AWS SQS queue.
- A second lambda should be triggered from the SQS queue and write the item to a dynamodb table.
Typescript would be best, but Javascript is also fine.
